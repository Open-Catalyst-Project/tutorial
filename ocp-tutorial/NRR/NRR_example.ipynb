We are so glad you could join us to learn a bit more about using OCP models to accelerate chemical simulations. We will reproduce Fig 6b from the following paper: Zhou, Jing, et al. \"Enhanced Catalytic Activity of Bimetallic Ordered Catalysts for Nitrogen Reduction Reaction by Perturbation of Scaling Relations.\" ACS Catalysis 13.4 (2023): 2190-2201. [link](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscatal.2c05877).\n","\n","To do this, we will enumerate adsorbate-slab configurations and run ML relaxations on them to find the lowest energy configuration. We will assess parity between the model predicted values and those reported in the paper. Finally we will make the figure and assess separability of the NRR favored and HER favored domains."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"cee85286-fcfe-452b-9017-7c0bce8168bf","metadata":{"id":"cee85286-fcfe-452b-9017-7c0bce8168bf"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/opt/conda/lib/python3.9/site-packages/tqdm/auto.py:21: TqdmWarning: IProgress not found.
